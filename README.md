// Description //
This project focused on creating JUnit test cases for each of the classes. 
Each class had a set of software requirements that needed to be followed, 
such as not exceeding the character limit or ensuring an object with the 
same ID string was not copied into the class' list. I tested for both the
pass and fail cases to ensure the code worked as intended.
