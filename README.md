### // Description //
This project focused on creating JUnit test cases for each of the classes. 
Each class had a set of software requirements that needed to be followed, 
such as not exceeding the character limit or ensuring an object with the 
same ID string was not copied into the class' list. I tested for both the
pass and fail cases to ensure the code worked as intended.

### // Testing Questions //

**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**<br>
To ensure my program's code is functional, I would use best practices by debugging often and checking that my code runs after writing a few lines. To ensure it is secure and works as intended, I would create test cases for my code to check for both success and failure.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**<br>
First, I would make a list of business and software requirements from the needs of the client or business. If there is something I am unsure of, I would speak with whoever is in charge of these requirements for further clarification. After completing the functionality of the requirement, I would create test unit cases for those requirements to ensure they fulfill their purpose.

**How do I approach designing software?**<br>
Designing software starts with thinking that the program will be about. Initially, a brainstorming session occurs with the needed requirements and functionalities in place before development of code can begin. Once these requirements have been written, I would design a basic test case for each requirement to ensure there is both a pass and fail scenario for the functionality. After that, if the client wish to express further details for each requirement, I would add those onto the original functions and test for those changes as well.
